## Installation

**Note that PHP 8.2+ is required**

The preferred method for installing Templado is to simply add it to your project using Composer.

If you are manually creating or editing the composer.json file:

```json
"require" : {
    "templado/engine": "^5.0"
}
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
# composer require templado/engine:^5.0
```
