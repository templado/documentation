Templado follows a different approach on templating: Being in part inspired by Tempan , Templado relies solely on plain HTML markup. The limited amount of display logic required is contained with the engine and triggered by the view model when it's applied to the Page. Always ready to preview As a Templado template is plain HTML, previewing is as easy as opening the HTML file with a browser - example data can and should be included as the engine will clean it up based on the view model upon rendering. No markup duplication Templado features asset support, mapping a list of assets based on their ID into a given HTML Page. To automate this process Templado CLI can be used. Combined with a File watcher in your IDE, you can have an always up-to-date set of HTML pages without ever writing a block twice. Form handling included To make form handling even more easy, Templado comes with explicit HTML Form support. Based on supplied Input data, Templado will repopulate the HTML form and even include your CSRF protection code. Custom transformations and Filters Templado allows for custom transformations, like adding a class to every a tag and string based replacements upon serialization.","title":"Index"},{"location":"features/#motivation","text":"Most of today's templating engines mix code for the required rendering logic with HTML markup in one file and require the developers to learn their respective language.

So this boils down to the following: PHP >= 8.2.0 Extensions dom libxml Note Please note that when you want to contribute to the development of Templado or if you just want to run the tests or some of the tools used during development of Templado like infection or psalm, additional extensions are required. As this is not a runtime requirement, those are not listed here. Install with Composer Templado is designed to be installed as a library using Composer , the defacto standard to install and manage runtime dependencies for PHP. The easiest way to add Templado to your project is from the CLI: $ composer require templado/engine:^5.0 If you prefer to manually create or edit the composer.json file, please add the following fragment to it. \"require\" : { \"templado/engine\": \"^5.0\" } For Templado, and its dependencies, to be actually installed after manually editing, you'd have to explicitly run composer install .","title":"Installation"},{"location":"start/install/#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"start/install/#runtime-requirements","text":"Templado merely requires an up-to-date PHP Version with XML and DOM support.

Templado uses View Models and HTML templates to accomplish this. So the first thing we need to do is introduce them to each other. 1. Loading the Template For Templado to operate, we need a Template to work with. From Templado's point of view, every Template is a Document . This can either be a complete HTML page - or just a fragment or snippet. A Templado Document can be instantiated either from a string or by supplying an already created instance of PHP's DOMDocument . For our first steps, we'll be using a String: $document = Templado\\Engine\\Document::fromString(' <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <title>Hello World, Templado!</title> </head> <body> <h1 property=\"headline\">My First Template</h1> </body> </html> '); Note While HTML can be represented using either the HTML or the XML serialization format, LibXML 2.x - the underlying engine that powers most of PHP's DOM support - does only support the HTML serialization format up to version 4. For that reason, and to avoid other quirks, Templado uses the XML mode when parsing a string. If you do not want this, feel free to create a DOMDocument by other means and pass that to Templado using the alternative factory method Templado\\Engine\\Document::fromDomDocument . 2. Applying a View Model Once a Document instance is available, a View Model can be applied. Templado relies on RDFa attributes embedded into the HTML to determine which methods to call on the current view model. More details on this, supported attributes and their respective meaning for Templado as well as more complex constructs can be found in the View Models section. The above basic HTML example contains a single RDFa attribute property . Templado uses this attribute, or rather the value of it, as the method name to call on the current view model and to determine what to do. The application of a very basic view Model to change text of the <h1> element could look like this: $document->applyViewModel(new class { public function headline(): string { return 'Hello world!'; } }); The property 's value is \"headline\", thus Templado is going to call the method named \"headline\" on the view model. Given the returned type is a string , the element's text content will be changed. 3. Serializing back to HTML Given the above sample model, Templado will replace the original text ('My First Template') with 'Hello world!'. To verify our success, we can have Templado serialize the Document back to HTML for us. We'll do so by using Templado's HTML Serializer. More on the serializer support can be found in the Serializer section. The HTML Serializer used here will ensure we produce sane HTML 5 output, despite the fact we use the XML mode internally: print $document->asString( new Templado\\Engine\\HTMLSerializer() ); The above should produce this output: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <title>Hello World, Templado!</title> </head> <body> <h1 property=\"headline\">Hello world!</h1> </body> </html> Congratulations, you just rendered your first HTML page using Templado!","title":"First Steps"},{"location":"start/start/#getting-started","text":"As with any templating engine, the main goal is to pair a template with a data source.
